# Waveform Scrolling Guide

## How to Scroll on the Waveform

### Method 1: Scroll Slider (Easiest)
- When zoomed to **1x or more**, a scroll slider appears at the top
- Drag the slider left/right to scroll through the track
- Shows current scroll time

### Method 2: Mouse Wheel Scrolling
- When zoomed to **more than 0.5x**, hover over waveform and scroll
- **Scroll up** = scroll left (earlier in track)
- **Scroll down** = scroll right (later in track)
- Each scroll = 2 seconds movement

### Method 3: Drag Scrolling
- When zoomed to **more than 0.5x**, click and drag on the waveform
- **Drag right** = scroll left (see earlier part)
- **Drag left** = scroll right (see later part)
- Cursor changes to 🖐️ grabbing when dragging

### Method 4: Keyboard Arrow Keys
- When zoomed to **more than 0.5x**, use arrow keys
- **← (Left Arrow)** = scroll left (500ms per press)
- **→ (Right Arrow)** = scroll right (500ms per press)
- Great for precise positioning
