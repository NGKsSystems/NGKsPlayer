# Waveform Scrolling Guide - FIXED ✅

## How to Scroll on the Waveform

### Method 1: Scroll Slider (Easiest)
- When song is **longer than visible area**, scroll slider appears
- Drag the slider left/right to scroll through the track
- Shows current scroll time

### Method 2: Mouse Wheel Scrolling
- When song is **longer than visible area**, hover over waveform and scroll
- **Scroll up** = scroll left (earlier in track)
- **Scroll down** = scroll right (later in track)
- Each scroll = 2 seconds movement

### Method 3: Drag Scrolling
- When song is **longer than visible area**, click and drag on the waveform
- **Drag right** = scroll left (see earlier part)
- **Drag left** = scroll right (see later part)
- Cursor changes to 🖐️ grabbing when dragging

### Method 4: Keyboard Arrow Keys
- When song is **longer than visible area**, use arrow keys
- **← (Left Arrow)** = scroll left (500ms per press)
- **→ (Right Arrow)** = scroll right (500ms per press)
- Great for precise positioning

## When Can You Scroll?

Scrolling is available when: **Total Song Duration > Visible Area**

### Examples:

**3-minute song at 0.5x zoom:**
- Visible: 120 seconds
- Total: 180 seconds
- ✅ CAN scroll (60 seconds scrollable)

**10-second sample at 1x zoom:**
- Visible: 60 seconds
- Total: 10 seconds
- ❌ CANNOT scroll (full song fits on screen)

**4-minute song at 5x zoom:**
- Visible: 12 seconds
- Total: 240 seconds
- ✅ CAN scroll (228 seconds scrollable)

## Quick Reference

| Zoom | View Duration | Action |
|------|---------------|--------|
| 0.1x | 600 seconds | Scroll if song > 10 min |
| 0.5x | 120 seconds | Scroll if song > 2 min |
| 1.0x | 60 seconds | Scroll if song > 1 min |
| 2.0x | 30 seconds | Scroll on most songs |
| 5.0x | 12 seconds | Always scrollable |

## Scrolling Methods Priority

1. **Slider** - Most intuitive
2. **Mouse wheel** - Fastest for small adjustments
3. **Drag** - Natural feel
4. **Arrow keys** - Most precise
